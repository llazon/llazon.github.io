# Implementing Secure Console Login on Linux with AWS SSM Agent

One of the most significant challenges in cloud infrastructure management is maintaining secure access to your servers. Traditional approaches like SSH with key pairs or passwords have their limitations and security concerns. AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent offers a more secure and flexible alternative for accessing your Linux EC2 instances without exposing SSH ports or managing key pairs.

## What is AWS SSM Agent?

AWS Systems Manager Agent is a software agent that runs on EC2 instances and enables Systems Manager to update, manage, and configure these resources. Among its many capabilities is the Session Manager feature, which allows you to establish secure shell connections to your instances without the need for:

- Opening inbound ports
- Managing bastion hosts
- Dealing with SSH keys

## Why Use SSM for Console Login?

- **Enhanced Security**: No need to expose port 22 or maintain SSH keys
- **Centralized Access Control**: Manage access through IAM permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All session activity can be logged to S3 and CloudWatch
- **No Bastion Hosts Required**: Direct access from the AWS Console or CLI
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS instances

## Prerequisites

Before implementing SSM for console login, ensure you have:

1. AWS EC2 instances running a supported Linux distribution
2. SSM Agent installed on your instances (pre-installed on many AWS AMIs)
3. An IAM instance profile with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` managed policy
4. Outbound internet access from your instances (or VPC endpoints for SSM)
5. AWS CLI installed on your local machine (optional, for CLI access)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Verify SSM Agent Installation

Most Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, and other AWS-provided AMIs come with SSM Agent pre-installed. To verify installation:

```bash
# For Amazon Linux, RHEL, CentOS
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent

# For Ubuntu
sudo systemctl status snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
```

If not installed, you can install it:

```bash
# Amazon Linux 2
sudo yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent

# Ubuntu
sudo snap install amazon-ssm-agent --classic
```

### 2. Create an IAM Instance Profile

Your EC2 instances need permissions to communicate with the SSM service:

1. Create a role in IAM
2. Attach the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy
3. Create an instance profile and associate it with the role
4. Attach the instance profile to your EC2 instances

Here's an example using AWS CLI:

```bash
# Create an IAM role
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name SSMInstanceRole \
  --assume-role-policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }'

# Attach the SSM policy
aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name SSMInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

# Create an instance profile
aws iam create-instance-profile \
  --instance-profile-name SSMInstanceProfile

# Add the role to the instance profile
aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
  --instance-profile-name SSMInstanceProfile \
  --role-name SSMInstanceRole
```

For existing instances, attach the profile:

```bash
aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile \
  --instance-id i-0123456789abcdef \
  --iam-instance-profile Name=SSMInstanceProfile
```

### 3. Set Up VPC Endpoints (Optional but Recommended)

If your instances are in a private subnet without internet access, you'll need to set up VPC endpoints:

```bash
# Create endpoints for SSM
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-0123456789abcdef \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ssm \
  --subnet-ids subnet-0123456789abcdef \
  --security-group-ids sg-0123456789abcdef \
  --vpc-endpoint-type Interface

# Endpoints for SSM Messages
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-0123456789abcdef \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ssmmessages \
  --subnet-ids subnet-0123456789abcdef \
  --security-group-ids sg-0123456789abcdef \
  --vpc-endpoint-type Interface
```

### 4. Configure Session Logging (Recommended)

Enable session logging to maintain an audit trail:

1. Navigate to the AWS Systems Manager console
2. Select Session Manager from the navigation pane
3. Choose "Preferences" and select "Enable"
4. Configure logging to CloudWatch Logs and/or S3

### 5. Access Your Instances

#### Via AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console
2. Navigate to Session Manager
3. Click "Start session"
4. Select your target instance
5. Click "Start session"

#### Via AWS CLI

```bash
# Start a session with an instance
aws ssm start-session --target i-0123456789abcdef

# For port forwarding (e.g., for database access)
aws ssm start-session \
  --target i-0123456789abcdef \
  --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
  --parameters '{"portNumber":["3306"], "localPortNumber":["3306"]}'
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Implement Least Privilege Access

Create custom IAM policies that restrict what users can do during sessions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:StartSession"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-0123456789abcdef"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:TerminateSession",
        "ssm:ResumeSession"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:session/${aws:username}-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Restrict Session Commands

Use Session Document parameters to control what commands users can run:

1. Create a custom Session document
2. Define allowed commands
3. Use this document when starting sessions

### 3. Implement Session Timeouts

Configure session timeouts in the Session Manager preferences:

1. Go to Session Manager > Preferences
2. Set "Maximum session duration"
3. Set "Idle session timeout"

## Troubleshooting

### Instance Not Showing in Session Manager

1. **Verify SSM Agent Status**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
```

2. **Check Instance Profile**:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef \
  --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].IamInstanceProfile'
```

3. **Review SSM Agent Logs**:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log
```

4. **Verify Network Connectivity**:
```bash
curl -s https://ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Session Terminating Immediately

1. Check that your user has the appropriate IAM permissions
2. Verify the SSM Agent is running and up-to-date
3. Ensure the instance has outbound internet access or VPC endpoints

## Advanced Configuration

### Running Sessions as a Specific User

By default, sessions run as the `ssm-user`. To run as a different user:

1. Create or edit `/etc/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.json`
2. Add:
```json
{
  "SessionManager": {
    "RunAsEnabled": true,
    "RunAsDefaultUser": "myuser"
  }
}
```
3. Restart the agent:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart amazon-ssm-agent
```

### Configure Shell Profile

Create a custom shell experience:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/profile.d/ssm-custom.sh > /dev/null << 'EOT'
# Custom prompt for SSM sessions
if [ -n "$AWS_EXECUTION_ENV" ]; then
  export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h (SSM Session)\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[34m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$ "
  echo "Welcome to SSM Session. This connection is logged and monitored."
fi
EOT
```

## Conclusion

AWS SSM Agent provides a secure, scalable, and audit-friendly alternative to traditional SSH access for Linux instances. By following the implementation steps above, you can:

1. Eliminate the need for SSH key management
2. Reduce your security footprint by closing inbound ports
3. Gain detailed audit logs of all session activities
4. Centralize access control through IAM policies

This approach aligns with AWS security best practices and simplifies infrastructure management across large environments. With SSM Session Manager, you maintain tight security while actually improving operational efficiencyâ€”a rare win-win in the security realm.
