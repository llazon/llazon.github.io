# Setting Up AWS Athena Access with AWS Identity Center

AWS Athena is a powerful serverless query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. By integrating Athena with AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO), you can provide secure, centralized access to your analytics infrastructure. This guide walks through the process of setting up AWS Athena logins with AWS Identity Center.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with administrative access
- AWS Identity Center enabled in your organization
- S3 bucket(s) containing your data
- Basic understanding of IAM policies and permissions

## Step 1: Enable AWS Identity Center

If you haven't already enabled AWS Identity Center:

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console
2. Search for "IAM Identity Center" 
3. Click "Enable" to set up Identity Center
4. Choose your identity source:
   - Use the default AWS Identity Center directory
   - Connect to your existing Active Directory
   - Connect to an external identity provider using SAML 2.0

## Step 2: Create Permission Sets

Permission sets define the level of access your users will have in AWS accounts.

1. In the AWS Identity Center console, navigate to "Permission sets"
2. Click "Create permission set"
3. Choose "Custom permission set" 
4. Give it a name like "AthenaAnalyst"
5. Create an inline policy with the following JSON:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "athena:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::aws-athena-query-results-*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-data-bucket*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "glue:CreateDatabase",
                "glue:DeleteDatabase",
                "glue:GetDatabase",
                "glue:GetDatabases",
                "glue:UpdateDatabase",
                "glue:CreateTable",
                "glue:DeleteTable",
                "glue:BatchDeleteTable",
                "glue:UpdateTable",
                "glue:GetTable",
                "glue:GetTables",
                "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
                "glue:CreatePartition",
                "glue:DeletePartition",
                "glue:BatchDeletePartition",
                "glue:UpdatePartition",
                "glue:GetPartition",
                "glue:GetPartitions",
                "glue:BatchGetPartition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note:** Replace `your-data-bucket*` with the actual S3 bucket(s) containing your data.

## Step 3: Assign Users and Groups

Now, assign your permission set to users or groups:

1. Navigate to "AWS accounts" in the Identity Center console
2. Select the account(s) where you want to enable Athena access
3. Choose "Assign users or groups"
4. Select the users or groups who need Athena access
5. Choose the "AthenaAnalyst" permission set
6. Review and confirm the assignment

## Step 4: Configure Athena Workgroups

Create and configure workgroups to organize users and manage query execution:

1. Navigate to the Athena console
2. Go to "Workgroups" and select "Create workgroup"
3. Name your workgroup (e.g., "AnalyticsTeam")
4. Configure settings:
   - Set the query result location to your S3 bucket
   - Enable query result encryption if needed
   - Configure query timeout settings
5. Add tags as needed for organizational purposes
6. Review and create the workgroup

## Step 5: Access Athena with Identity Center Authentication

To access Athena using Identity Center:

1. Users navigate to your organization's AWS access portal URL
   - Typically `https://d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/start` 
2. Sign in with their Identity Center credentials
3. Select the appropriate AWS account
4. Choose the "AthenaAnalyst" role
5. Navigate to the Athena service
6. Select the appropriate workgroup and start querying data

## Step 6: Enhanced Security with Lake Formation (Optional)

For more granular control over data access:

1. Navigate to the Lake Formation console
2. Register your S3 bucket(s) as data lake locations
3. Create Lake Formation permissions
4. Grant table and column-level permissions to specific IAM roles that correspond to your Identity Center permission sets

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Access denied errors**: Verify that your permission set includes all necessary permissions for Athena, S3, and Glue.
- **Can't see tables**: Ensure that Glue catalog permissions are properly configured.
- **Query results not saving**: Check S3 bucket permissions for the query results location.

## Conclusion

By connecting AWS Athena with AWS Identity Center, you've established a secure, centralized authentication system for your data analytics platform. Users can now access Athena with their organizational credentials while administrators maintain control over access permissions.

This setup improves security by removing the need for long-term IAM credentials and simplifies the user experience through single sign-on capabilities.
